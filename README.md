# react-native-image-crop-picker-example
This is [React Native Image Crop Picker](https://github.com/ivpusic/react-native-image-crop-picker) Example. It was scaffolded by `react-native init`

The purpose of this repositoby is to compare with react-native CameraRoll API. Their Image component has performance issue with [overheated device problem](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/22393). so change react native view to pure native UI and verify it.

Here are the other project [https://github.com/vreality64/react-native-camera-roll-example]
